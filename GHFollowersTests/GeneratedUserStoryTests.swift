Certainly! Below is a simple Swift file with a header comment that includes the filename, author, and date. The file contains a function that prints "Hello, World!".

```swift
// Filename: HelloWorld.swift
// Author: Your Name
// Date: October 3, 2023

import Foundation

func printHelloWorld() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}

// Call the function
printHelloWorld()
```

Replace "Your Name" with your actual name if needed. You can save this code in a file named `HelloWorld.swift`. When you run this file, it will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
