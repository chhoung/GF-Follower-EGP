Certainly! Below is a simple Swift file that includes a header comment with the filename, author, and date, along with a function that prints "Hello, World!".

```swift
//
//  HelloWorld.swift
//  Author: Your Name
//  Date: October 4, 2023
//

import Foundation

func printHelloWorld() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}

// Call the function to print Hello World
printHelloWorld()
```

Replace "Your Name" with your actual name or the desired author name. This Swift file can be run in any Swift-compatible environment or playground.
